# The History of Douglas Adams and The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy
### By Nabih Estefan 

This is the repository where I'm keeping my documents for my Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy independent study. There are two types of documents here: There is the big PDF timeline where I recap tha story of Hitchhiker's, and "reports" I made as I read/watched/listened to all the documents, they are mostly just my random thoughts and feelings about them and have awide range of structure to just random thoughts depending on how the novel, show, movie, comic, etc. made me feel.
